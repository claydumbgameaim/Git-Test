Compiling and Running TCP

Have another computer to be a client and a server.

Go to their respected directories on the both command prompts and make sure you have gcc compiler installed, eg cygwin.

In TCP, to send a certain size, have to go in the source code and change the MAXDATASIZE for both tcp_client and tcp_server and have to be synchronized.

- COMPILING - 

TCP Server: type in gcc tcp_server.c -o tcp_server
		Hit Enter.

TCP Client: type in gcc tcp_client.c -o tcp_client
		Hit Enter.

In a different command prompt,

UDP Server: type in gcc udp_server.c -o udp_server
		Hit Enter.

UDP Client: type in gcc udp_client.c -o udp_client
		Hit Enter.

- RUNNING -

TCP Server: type in ./tcp_server
		Hit Enter.

TCP Client: type in ./tcp_client <IP address of TCP Server>
		Hit Enter.

UDP Server: type in ./udp_server
		Hit Enter.

UDP Client: type in ./udp_client <IP address of UDP Server>
            UDP client will prompt asking what size packets to send and how many packets to send. Enter in Numbers only. Hit Enter.
